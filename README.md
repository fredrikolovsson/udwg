Urban Dictionary Wordlist generator
================================================================================
Recently I was curious about downloading a wordlist from Urban Dictionary.
I noticed there was no such list available for download from their website.

I therefore have created this simple Web Scraper which compiles a list of all
of the available words from Urban Dictionary to date.

If you are reading this, you probably have a good reason for needing a 
wordlist from urban dictionary, such as security, NLP, or just plain curiosity.

This program is written in Python and is very easy to use, just simply type:

$> python uswg.py

And a file will be generated with the name ud_wordlist_DDMMYYYY.txt

Where DD is the current day, MM is the current month, and YYYY is the current
year. 

The structure of the file is like any other wordlist file, with a list of terms
delimited by the newline character.

Enjoy.
