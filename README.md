# Urban Dictionary Wordlist Generator

Recently I was curious about downloading a wordlist from Urban Dictionary.
I noticed there was no such list available for download from their website.

I therefore have created this simple Web Scraper which compiles a list of
the most popular words from Urban Dictionary from A to Z

If you are reading this, you probably have a good reason for needing a 
wordlist from urban dictionary, such as security, NLP, or just plain curiosity.

## Usage

At this point, the program is command line only

This program is written in Python and is very easy to use, just simply type:

    $> python udwg.py

And all words from Urban Dictionary will be printed out

The words are all of the most popular words from Urban Dictionary from A to Z.

## Wordlist structure

The structure of the file is like any other wordlist file, with a list of terms
delimited by the newline character.

A wordlist file is available called `popular_words.txt` in the repository.

##Disclaimer

This project absolutely no affiliation with the website Urban Dictionary.

All contents generated by this program are used at the discretion of the user.
I do not condone the use of this data for illicit purposes.

## Requirements

I used the following versions of python and corresponding modules for testing.

[BeautifulSoup 4.3.2](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

[Python 3.4.4](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
